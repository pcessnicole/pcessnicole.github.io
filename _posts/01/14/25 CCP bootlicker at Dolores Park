CCP bootlicker at Dolores Park

met a ccp bootlicker while lazing about dolores in SF. he was walking with a friend and approached me, and it took me way to long to realize he was actually talking to me. 

like any good ccp bootlicker, he rents from a chinese landlord in chinatown, lived in korea and china for x years.  he was shockingly open about being divorced to a 21 year old  girl he married when he was 25. he claims she cheated, but itâ€™s obvious he has no social skills or probably any skills outside of pecking the keyboard and producing AI bot stuff to replace us all, happily doing so for some $300,000 per year package at some startup.
