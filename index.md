Maybe say a some things about yourself. hmmm. socially awkward, love talking but somehow and introvert. a quarter of a century year(s) old, near college drop out but promised my parents id finish. spent 18 years in the same
hometown. hiking, camping, the occasional relationship i guess. 

not sure whats gonna be in the blog.
